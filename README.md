Welcome to the Terrestrial Vitrification Project – a smart, Raspberry Pi-powered solution that automates plant care with automated watering and grow lights, real-time moisture monitoring, and (allegedly) stunning timelapse videos. Better yet, it's open-source! Perfect for hobbyists, educators, or IoT enthusiasts building sustainable green spaces!

🚀 Project Overview

This project integrates sensors, relays, a GUI, and camera control to create a fully autonomous greenhouse:
		
	💡Monitors soil moisture via sensors.
		
	💡Automates watering and grow lights based on schedules and data.
		
	💡Captures hourly timelapse photos and compiles them into videos.
		
	💡Built with Python for easy customization.
		
🗝️ Key Features:
		
	💡User-friendly GUI (main.py) for control and status.
		
	💡Wide-open source: You can make this project better! Think of the possibilities.
		
	💡Remote design: Tired of having to touch grass to monitor the greenhouse? Now you don't have to!

🛠️ Quick Start

	😵‍💫Check: are you on the right system? 

		If you are on anything other than a Raspberry Pi running a minimized install of Ubuntu Server, you are on an unsupported platform*. While this project may expand to cover you in the future, it doesn't right now. On the other hand, we certainly aren't going to try to stop you from ignoring this paragraph and building this anyway; just don't expect a warantee or whatever. 

	😵‍💫Check: are you a superuser?

		💡Open a terminal and type: 
			sudo echo "hello world"
		If this does not work, then you need to take this up with your administrator, because although we won't stop you from circumventing this, they certainly will.

	⏰The scary part: We haven't tested this stuff very thuroughly yet, and so 
	***IF THIS BREAKS YOUR SYSTEM, DON'T BE SURPRISED.*** 
	With that out of the way:

	💡Release upgrade: We only support Ubuntu Server 25.10 officially*. Therefore, BEING VERY CLEAR THAT THIS IS PLAYING WITH FIRE, you can run these two commands to get there:
		sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade && reboot
		sudo do-release-upgrade -d || reboot
	
	💡In order to build this software, you will need some dependencies. In order to get them, you can run these commands.
		cd ~/ && sudo apt install --install-recommends fortunes fortune g++ pkgconf ffmpeg libopenjp2-7 libcamera-dev libfmt-dev libdrm-dev git pipx gcc gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu libcap-dev python3-dev libgl1 libgirepository-2.0-dev libcairo2-dev pkg-config gir1.2-gtk-4.0 python3-pip clang dbus-x11 && git clone https://github.com/yeetmanthecoolman/greenhaus.git && pipx ensurepath && reboot
		cd ~/ && pipx install -vvv poetry && cd ./greenhaus && poetry install -vvv --all-groups --all-extras --compile && cd ./src/greenhaus && poetry run greenhaus start-gui

	😵‍💫Need a wheel? Conveniently, I made that real simple:
		cd ~/GreenhousePython && poetry build -f wheel
	
	💡When you want to run the script again, you can run:
		cd ~/ && sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade && cd ./greenhaus && poetry update -vvv && cd ./src/greenhaus && poetry run greenhaus start-gui
			
	💡To uninstall the greenhouse project, we will need to make an uninstall command. We have not gotten it working yet.
